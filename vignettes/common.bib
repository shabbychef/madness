     abstract = {Asymptotic distributions of the estimators of the Sharpe and Treynor performance measures are derived. Multivariate performance comparison measures, based on the traditional Sharpe and Treynor measures, are developed with their corresponding asymptotic distributions. The behavior of these new performance measures are evaluated in small samples. For single comparisons, a Sharpe z statistic is well behaved and for multiple comparisons a Sharpe chi-square statistic is reasonably well behaved. The powers of the tests are quite sensitive to the population coefficients of variation. Multivariate test statistics based upon the Treynor measure were not very satisfactory.},
